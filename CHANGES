0.2.3
=====
- support "min_compress_len" and "memcached_expire_time"
  with python-memcached backend.  Tests courtesy
  Justin Azoff #3

- Add support for coercion of string config values
  to Python objects - ints, "false", "true", "None".
  #4

- Added support to DBM file lock to allow reentrant
  access per key within a single thread, so that 
  even though the DBM backend locks for the whole file,
  a creation function that calls upon a different
  key in the cache can still proceed.  #5

- Fixed DBM glitch where multiple readers 
  could be serialized.

- Adjust bmemcached backend to work with newly-repaired
  bmemcached calling API (see bmemcached 
  ef206ed4473fec3b639e).
