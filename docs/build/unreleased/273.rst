    Fixed issue where :meth:`.MemoryBackend.configure` would unexpectedly
    modify the input arguments dictionary by removing its contents. The method
    now preserves the original arguments dictionary as expected, consistent
    with the behavior of other backend types.  Pull request courtesy Nicolas
